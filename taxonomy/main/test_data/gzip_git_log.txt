    zgrep: don't assume traditional behavior with signal numbers
    
    * zgrep.in: Don't assume the exit status is the signal number plus
    128, as POSIX doesn't require this.  No need to kill self; exiting
    with large status is enough.  Propagate all exit statuses greater
    than 1, not merely those in the range 129..143, as there's no need
    to treat that range specially (and it's not portable anyway).

    zgrep: fix shell portability bug with -f; fix mishandling of "-e -"
    
    * tests/zgrep-f: Check for "zgrep -e -" bug, too.
    * zgrep.in: Don't assume that if the shell redirects fd 6, then
    this redirection is visible to the subsidiary grep.  POSIX doesn't
    guarantee this visibility except for file descriptors 0, 1, and 2,
    and ksh does not support it.  Problem reported by Thomas Schulz in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gzip/2010-11/msg00000.html>.
    Also, fix a related bug: "-e -" was mishandled.  These two bugs
    were introduced by commit 5b54db4546b84ec97ff57a62f8ddb98faacf77f2
    dated 2009-10-09.
    (escape): Change the convention: do not assume that a stray X
    is present at the end of the last line.  All uses changed.
    There was no longer any need for this convention, and fixing this
    made it a bit easier to use 'sed' in a later part of the fix.

    maint: fix copyright dates that were munged by a maintenance script
    
    * gunzip.in, gzexe.in, zcat.in, zcmp.in, zdiff.in, zforce.in:
    * zgrep.in, zless.in, zmore.in, znew.in:
    A script went awry when updating copyright dates in gzip's shell
    scripts.  It should update comments to look like "# Copyright (C)
    2007, 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc." (with a set of years)
    and version messages to look like "Copyright (C) 2010 Free
    Software Foundation, Inc." (with just the most-recent year).
    Instead, it sometimes ignored one, sometimes the other, and
    typically put ranges into version messages.  Fix all this stuff by
    hand, using dates that I divined from the change logs (so they're
    a bit more accurate than script-generated dates).  We need to fix
    the script before it runs in 2011.

    gzip: fix a data-loss bug when decompressing with --suffix=''
    
    * gzip.c (main): Disallow an empty --suffix=S also with -d.
    Otherwise, "gzip -d -S '' F.gz" would ask if it's ok to remove the
    existing file, "F.gz";  if you reply "yes", you'd lose all of that data.
    Use of an empty suffix was already rejected in compression mode.
    * gzip.1 (--suffix (-S)): Do not recommend to use "gunzip -S '' *".
    Describe how the suffix is used when decompressing, too.
    * NEWS (Bug fixes): mention the fix.
    Reported by Ripduman Sohan.

    than clearing it -- and output the first magic byte.

    zgrep: terminate gracefully when a pipeline is interrupted by a signal
    
    zgrep is not terminated gracefully when its grep/sed pipeline
    is terminated by a signal.  For example, a command like
    zgrep -F .TH /usr/share/man/man1/*.gz | head
    continues working long after the "head" process completes.
    Another example, a command like
    zgrep unmatched-pattern /usr/share/man/man1/*.gz
    cannot be interrupted by sending a SIGQUIT with Ctrl-\ key, it outputs
    zgrep: line 221: test: : integer expression expected
    and goes on.
    * zgrep.in: Terminate gracefully when the grep/sed pipeline is
    terminated by a signal.
    * tests/zgrep-signal: New test.
    * Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

    It is unnecessary, since Makefile.am's TESTS_ENVIRONMENT setting
    already adds the top build directory, and besides, is only
    marginally useful when running stand-alone, since it presumes
    that the script is being run from the top build directory.

    build: do not override gnulib-provided AM_CFLAGS options
    
    Avoid a warning from automake:
    lib/Makefile.am:24: AM_CFLAGS multiply defined in condition TRUE ...
    lib/gnulib.mk:30: ... `AM_CFLAGS' previously defined here
    lib/Makefile.am:20:   `lib/gnulib.mk' included from here
    
    * lib/Makefile.am (AM_CFLAGS): Append $(WARN_CFLAGS) and
    $(WERROR_CFLAGS), i.e., use "+=", not "=".
    This was introduced via 2009-12-17 commit 0341fc22,
    "build: with --enable-gcc-warnings, use -Werror",
    but fortunately is not a bug, because the definition
    it would have overridden was always empty.

    gzip -d would fail with a CRC error...
    
    ...for some inputs, and some memcpy implementations.  It is possible
    that an offending input has to be compressed "from FAT filesystem
    (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT)", since the sole reproducer no longer evokes a
    CRC error when uncompressed and recompressed on a GNU/Linux system.
    Also, using an unpatched reverse-memcpy-gzip on over 100,000 inputs
    on a GNU/Linux system did not turn up another reproducer.
    * inflate.c (inflate_codes): Don't call memcpy with overlapping regions.
    Properly detect when source and destination overlap.
    * tests/memcpy-abuse: New test, to trigger misbehavior.
    * Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
    * NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

    (bin_SCRIPTS, MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Add gunzip, zcat, zcmp, zdgrep, zfgrep.
    (.in): Use GZIP_BINDIR as the location of gzip binaries, if it is set.
    (check-local): Use GZIP_BINDIR.
    (install-exec-hook, remove-installed-links): Make 'uncompress' an
    alias for gunzip.
    * gzexe.1: At least one arg is required.  Don't give cat as an
    example, since gzexe refuses to compress cat due to a bootstrapping
    issue.  List more utilities in this category.
    * gzexe.in, zdiff.in, zforce.in, zgrep.in, zless.in, zmore.in, znew.in:
    Report our name in usage.
    * gzexe.in: Don't compress bash.  Don't use rmdir, so it's
    OK to compress rmdir.
    * gzip.c: Now requires that you compile with -DGNU_STANDARD=0 to
    get non GNU-standard behavior.  We now build with GNU-standard
    behavior by default, so that programs do not depend on the names
    of their executables.
    * zdiff.in: Don't depend on the name of the executable, as per
    GNU standard.  Instead, rely on an internal --__cmp option.
    Support ' in options.  Check for failures in subsidiary gzip
    invocations.
    * zgrep.1: Clarify compression issues.
    * zgrep.in: Don't assume POSIX-style case syntax.  Remove unused var
    have_optarg.
    * zless.1: zless sets LESSMETACHARS now.

    * NEWS: Fix bug reported by Martin Mares in

    * gzip.c (treat_stdin): Remove NO_STDIN_FSTAT and NO_PIPE_TIMESTAMP

    Report an error if stdin cannot be statted even if !list && no_time.
    Get stdin's size if it is regular.
    (treat_file): Do not report an error with setuid, setgid,
    sticky, or non-regular, non-directory files if to_stdout.
    Allow 'force' to override the caution about sticky files.
    Use the same form for time stamps that treat_stdin uses.

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Sun Dec 24 04:14:57 2006 +0000

    * zdiff.in: Fix typo that broke most usages.  Problem reported by
    Jari Aalto in <http://bugs.debian.org/404114>.  While we're at it,
    fix a bunch of other problems.  Handle "-" better.  Send
    diagnostics to stderr, not stdout.  Use expr rather than echo |
    sed, to handle special characters better.  Report a diagnostic in
    the 1-arg case, if the argument doesn't end in .gz or the like,
    rather than having incomprehensible behavior.  Do not require that
    the inputs be regular files.  Avoid creating a temporary entirely,
    if /dev/fd works.  If not, then resist denial-of-service attacks
    better, by using mktemp.
    * Makefile.am (gzip.doc.gz): New rule.
    (check-local): Depend on it, and test zdiff for Debian bug 404114.

    * inflate.c (huft_build): Fix regression that caused gzip to
    refuse to uncompress null input (all zero length codes).  Problem
    reported by Yiorgos Adamopoulos.  This regression was caused by
    the security patch installed 2006-11-20, which in turn came from
    Debian, which in turn apparently came from Thomas Biege of SuSe.

    * gzip.c (treat_file) [!HAVE_CHOWN]: Don't call chown.
    * gzip.c: Include "timespec.h".  This doesn't fix any bugs, but
    it is clearer.

Date:   Thu Dec 7 06:58:13 2006 +0000

    * NEWS: Document the fixes below.
    * configure.ac (AC_CHECK_FUNCS_ONCE): Add siginterrupt.
    * gzip.c (lstat) [!defined(HAVE_LSTAT) && !defined(lstat)]: Remove.
    (SA_NOCLDSTOP, sigprocmask, sigset_t) [!defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]:
    New macros.
    (siginterrupt) [!defined SA_NOCLDSTOP && ! HAVE_SIGINTERRUPT]:
    New macro.
    (HAVE_WORKING_O_NOFOLLOW): Define to 0 if not defined.
    (caught_signals, exiting_signal, remove_ofname_fd): New vars.
    (remove_ofname): Remove; all uses changed to remove_ofname_fd.
    (same_file, name_too_long): Remove.
    (install_signal_handlers): New function.  It prefers sigaction,
    which is more reliable in the presence of race conditions.
    Catch SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ, too.
    (main): Use it instead of installing them by hand.
    (treat_file): Check for read error when closing ifd.
    (treat_file, create_outfile, remove_output_file):
    Avoid race conditions with signals.
    (create_outfile, check_ofname): Remove most of the gorp about
    working around ENAMETOOLONG deficiencies.  It's obsolete now, and
    anyway it had race conditions.  Just rely on O_EXCL and
    ENAMETOOLONG.  The worst that can happen is that a file name will
    be silently truncated on an obsolete machine, but no data will be lost.
    (open_and_stat): Use HAVE_WORKING_O_NOFOLLOW rather than O_NOFOLLOW
    to work around some O_NOFOLLOW bugs.  Otherwise, fall back on
    lstat only if lstat is available, as symlinks don't exist otherwise.
    (open_input_file): Use O_NONBLOCK and O_NOCTTY too, to avoid
    hanging gzip on special files.
    (abort_gzip_signal): If sigaction is not available, ignore
    signals.  If we get the exiting signal, exit with ERROR status
    rather than raising a signal.
    * tailor.h (NO_ST_INO): Remove; no longer used now that same_file
    is gone.

    Matthew Woehlke in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gzip/2006-11/msg00013.html>.
    * bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove openat, as it pulls in
    fchdir.
    * configure.ac: Check for fdopendir.
    * gzip.c: Don't include openat.h; no longer needed.
    (treat_dir) [!HAVE_FDOPENDIR]: Fall back on the old opendir method
    since fdopendir is not available.

    * NEWS: Describe the following change briefly.
    * bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove stat-macros; no longer
    needed.
    * gzip.c: Don't include stat-macros.h; no longer needed.
    (treat_file): Refuse to compress files that are setuid, or setgid,
    as this can in theory lead to security holes.  Also, refuse to
    compress files with the sticky bit set, on general principle.
    (copy_stat): Don't copy the setuid, setgid, or sticky bits,
    as (given the above change) they'll always be zero here.
    Invoke chmod before chown, to close a race condition.

commit 873e56c3ba906ae217d25e85d7515e8f4c775e32
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Fri Dec 1 20:52:52 2006 +0000

    * NEWS: Describe gzexe changes noted below.
    * Makefile.am (.in): Don't bother with SEDCMD.  This stuff isn't needed
    any more (the hosts it caters to are long extinct), and was questionable
    anyway since the code assumes the skip= line was line 2.
    * configure.ac (AC_SYS_INTERPRETER, SEDCMD): Remove; no longer needed.
    
    * gzexe.in: Sweep the code and fix some bugs.
    My, what sharp teeth you have, gzexe!
    The straw that broke this camel's back was Matthew Burgess's bug report
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gzip/2006-11/msg00012.html>.
    
    (IFS): Set it to the standard value, both here and in the
    script gzexe generates.
    Check for missing operand after parsing options, not before.
    This fixes the case for "cpexe --".
    Check for tail -n problem separately in gzexe and in the executable
    it generates, in case it's a different 'tail'.
    (trap): Remove $tmp only if $tmp is not the empty string.
    Preserve exit status.
    Don't use the nonstandard (and rarely available) "cpmod" utility.
    Don't use "set -C"; it's no longer useful and it breaks things
    in some cases.
    (main loop): Handle file names beginning with "-".
    Exit with status of failing program, not with 1.
    Fix some bugs in printing diagnostics, and in quoting.
    Require the skip= line to have at least one digit.
    Use test -u and test -g rather than using the (less-reliable) ls.
    Refuse to compress more programs, e.g., sh.
    Use mktemp rather than tempfile.  Build a copy of
    the compressed or uncompressed executable in the same
    directory as the executable, as that's less likely to go wrong
    if disk space is low.  Have the executable exit with status 127,
    not 1, if the decompression process fails; this is more compatible
    with meta-programs like nohup.  Have the executable
    uncompress to a temp file with the same basename as the executable;
    this is more likely to go right.  Fix a race condition where the
    executable temporarily did not exist (in either old or new forms).
    Check for race conditions better when mv fails.  Do not attempt
    to use cp to do the real work, only to copy permissions to a temp
    file, since we don't want to trash running executables.

    * Makefile.am (FILES_TO_CHECK): New macro.
    (check-local): Check only the files in FILES_TO_CHECK, since some
    files under the working directory might be mutating as the test is
    run, e.g., with "make check >log".  Problem reported by Jim
    Meyering.

    and fchown, not utime.
    (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove; rpmatch is now done by gnulib.
    (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add doc/Makefile, lib/Makefile.
    
    * bits.c: Use the more-usual form for copyright notices in source code.
    * deflate.c: Likewise.
    * gzip.c: Likewise.
    * gzip.h: Likewise.
    * inflate.c: Likewise.

    * unzip.c: Likewise.
    * util.c: Likewise.
    * crypt.c (dummy): Add decl so that pedantic compilers won't
    complain about an empty file.
    * gzip.c (license_msg): Use more-modern wording.
    Include fcntl-safer.h, openat.h, stat-macros.h, stat-time.h.
    Simply include <dirent.h> if !NO_DIR, removing a rats-nest of
    #ifdefs.
    Simply include <utimens.h> if !defined NO_UTIME, removing a
    another rats-nest of #ifdefs.
    (DIR_OPT, TIME_OPT): Remove.
    (_D_EXACT_NAMLEN): Renamed from NAMLEN.  All uses changed.
    (S_ISDIR, S_ISREG, O_BINARY, O_CREAT, O_EXCL, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR):
    Remove; gnulib now does this.
    (RETSIGTYPE): Remove; Autoconf does this.
    (program_name): Renamed from progname, for compatibility with gnulib.
    All uses changed.
    (time_stamp): Now struct timespec, not time_t.  All uses changd.
    (remove_oftime): Now volatile.
    (reset_times): Remove; now done by futimens.
    (usage): Remove.
    (try_help): New function.
    (help, license): Don't output date as part of version.
    A version number suffices.
    (help): Redo help message to match style of coreutils etc.
    (version): Don't bother printing compile-time configuration info
    like STDC_HEADERS.
    (main): Don't assume strlen (argv[0]) < INT_MAX (!).
    On usage errors, suggest --help without outputting all the help.
    (main, do_list): Remove unnecessary casts.
    (treat_stdin, treat_file, get_method, copy_stat):
    Support sub-second time stamp resolution.
    (treat_file, copy_istat): Close some race conditions if files are
    renamed as we read or write them.
    (treat_file): Do not attempt to reset the access times of
    directories that we read.
    (open_and_stat, open_input_file): New functions.
    (do_stat, get_istat): Remove; most of the contents went to these new
    functions.
    (make_ofname): Don't use WARN, as it affects exit status.
    (get_method): When the original file name was truncated,
    restore from its base name, not from its full name.
    (do_list): Avoid undefined behavior with out-of-range time stamps.
    ctime, for example, cannot be invoked on arbitrary time stamps safely,
    since it might overrun an internal buffer.  Do not assume that
    localtime succeeds.
    (copy_stat): Do not remove input file; that's now the caller's
    responsibility.  This avoids a problem if there is a write error
    when the caller closes the output file.
    (treat_dir): New arg FD, to avoid a race condition.  All uses changed.
    (remove_output_file): New function.
    (abort_gzip): Use it.
    (abort_gzip_signal): New function, which is async-signal-safe.
    Exit with the signal that we got.
    * gzip.h (program_name, time_stamp, abort_gzip): Adjust decls to
    match gzip.c changes.
    * inflate.c (huft_build): Return 2 if null input.
    * tailor.h (HAVE_UTIME): Do not define; gnulib does this now.
    (OPEN): Use open_safer, not plain open.
    * unlzh.c (NPT): Set to 1<<TBIT, not to the maximum of NT and NP.
    (make_table): Report an error if 1<<tablebits < nextcode.
    (read_pt_len): Report an error if 16 < c.
    * unpack.c (read_tree): Report an error if the tree has too many
    leaves while reading it.  Fix off-by-one error in final check.
    * util.c: Include <xalloc.h>, for xalloc_die decl.
    (gzip_base_name): Renamed from base_name, so we don't collide
    with gnulib.  All uses changed.
    (add_envopt): Use xstrdup instead of xmalloc+strcpy.
    Use xcalloc rather than calloc + check.
    (gzip_error): Renamed from error, so we don't collide with gnulib.
    All uses changed.
    (xalloc_die): New function.
    (xmalloc): Remove; no longer needed.
    * zip.c (zip): Watch for time stamp overflow; the old code
    mishandled negative time stamps.
    
    * gzexe.in: Add support for --help, --version, --.
    Don't call basename or sed if we can avoid it.
    * zdiff.in: Likewise.
    * zforce.in: Likewise.
    * zgrep.in: Likewise.
    * zless.in: Likewise.
    * zmore.in: Likewise.
    * znew.in: Likewise.
    * zdiff.in: Protect against file names beginning with "-".
    * zmore.in: Likewise.
    * zgrep.in: Use printf rather than echo, to avoid problems with
    leading "-" and backslash.  Return status of subsidiary grep.
    * zless.in: Add copyright notice.
    
    * zless.1: We now pass "--" to LESSOPEN.
    (BUGS): Mention that input file arguments are required.
    Add copyright notice.
    
    * COPYING: Update to current version.
    
    * Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): New macro.
    (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove; now done in configure.ac.
    (M4DIR, ACINCLUDE_INPUTS): Remove.
    (EXTRA_DIST): Remove getopt.h.
    (gzip_SOURCES): Remove getopt.c, getopt1.c, yesno.c.
    (gzip_LDADD): Change from @LIBOBJS@ to lib/libgzip.a.
    (AM_MAKEINFOFLAGS, info_TEXINFOS, gzip_TEXINFOS, ASCPP, LN_S):
    (match.$(OBJEXT)): Move to subdirectory makefiles.
    (.in): Substitute @VERSION@, too.
    (check-local): New rule.
    (MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Add _match.S.
    
    * doc/gzip.texi: Renamed from gzip.texi.  Change to GNU FDL
    without invariant sections or cover texts.  Don't put
    version number or date into sample gzip -h output.
    * lib/match.c: Renamed from match.c.  Add ia64 version
    written by Sverre Jarp (HP Labs).
    
    * INSTALL: Remove from CVS; now created automatically by
    the bootstrap script.

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Sun Sep 29 06:45:28 2002 +0000

    Use shell pattern matching instead of 'expr', which mishandles names
    like "+".  Remove old check for 14-byte file names on hosts with
    broken "mv" implementations, as such systems aren't in use any more
    and it's better nowadays to support file names longer than 14 bytes.
